# GamemodeBuild
*It's kinda like Creative!*

GamemodeBuild adds a Creative-like build mode to Minecraft. Players can access whitelisted blocks for building, but cannot instantly destroy blocks or fly.

## Usage
### Players
Players can press `B` to access the build mode at any time. This will replace their inventory with a GUI that shows all available blocks.

### Operators
**Please note: Permission level 4 is needed for these commands!**

Operators can toggle access, update filters & more via in-game commands!
For info, run `/build help` in game

## Updating
Porting & updating of GamemodeBuild usually happens in the earlier months of the year, following the Love Tropics stream cycle.
If you'd like to contribute an early port or any updates, please make a PR and we'll take a look at it whenever we can!
